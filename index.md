## Case #3

## HPI
> - A 27-year-old woman was seen in the emergency department of this hospital during the summer because of arthralgias and a rash. She had just returned from a trip to Turks and Caicos.

> - The patient had been well until 5 days before this evaluation, when myalgias in her hands and shoulders developed, along with back pain, neck pain, and a retro-orbital headache.

> - Later that day, fever occurred (temperature, 39.0°C) and was accompanied by chills, nausea, decreased appetite, and sore throat. She also noted a vaginal ulcer, ulcers on the side of her tongue, decreased taste sensation, and enlarged, tender lymph nodes in her neck and groin. 

> - The next morning, the patient awoke with a rash on her right forearm. The lesions were pink, pruritic, and nonpainful. Within 1 hour, the rash spread to her torso and both arms and legs.

> - Her gums bled easily when she brushed her teeth, but the rash remitted.

> - On the fifth day of illness, a new pruritic, erythematous rash developed, beginning on her palms and spreading to her arms, chest, abdomen, back, and legs, sparing the soles of her feet.

## Objective information
> - The patient appeared well. The temperature was 36.4°C, the pulse 69 beats per minute, the blood pressure 135/87 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. 

> - There was subtle swelling of soft tissue in the hands but no joint effusions.

## Presentation and workup

> - A 45-year-old woman was seen in an outpatient clinic in Heidelberg, Germany for fever of up to 39°C and rash covering her trunk, arms, and legs.

> - Fever had started on 2 days previously, which was 6 days after she had returned from a 3-week vacation to peninsular Malaysia and Sabah, Malaysian Borneo.

> - Laboratory analyses showed a slightly elevated C-reactive protein level of 5.2 mg/L (reference range <5.0), but liver function test and complete blood count results were within reference range. 

> - During the next 3 days, the fever subsided, but the patient experienced a sore throat, bilateral conjunctivitis, and a burning sensation of the palms and soles. These symptoms were accompanied by swelling of the hands and increasing arthralgia of the wrists, palms, and fingers. There was no lymphadenopathy. 

> - Two days later, the patient experienced sudden bilateral dull and metallic hearing; in her left ear, she experienced a very short delay between a sound and her perception of the sound.
