## Case #1

---
## Initial presentation

> - A 26 y/o presented to the ED in Toronto in early September with fever, myalgia, and headache. Headache started 3 days earlier. It was intermittent and was accompanied by some mild diplopia. She vomited twice yesterday and had no other GI symptoms. 

> - She recently returned from a trip to Thailand where she had bloody diarrhea about two weeks ago that resolved in a day with administration of an unknown antibiotic. Her trip was last minute and she did not consult a travel clinic. She had not traveled abroad previously. Most of her time in country was spent trekking through the forests and rice field areas.

> - Histories
  - No PMH
  - No PSH
  - No Meds
  - No allergies

## JEV is found largely in the East Asia

![](assets/img/jev_geography.png)

--- &vcenter
## Epidemiology of JEV

> - Initial presentation is sometimes confused with polio
  - Early symptoms resemble flu-like illness--fever, headache, lethergy, nausea, vomiting--and advances to florid encephalitis
> - First discovered in 1934, but summertime outbreaks with thousands of cases were described previously as Japanese B encephalitis

> - Reported cases are vastly underreporting based on serological surveys
  - Approximately 35,000 - 50,000 cases and 10,000 - 15,000 deaths are reported annually
  - This is the most commonly reported encephalitis virus worldwide
> - __"More than 99% of infections with JEV are subclinical; consequently, in areas with endemic transmission, infections acquired naturally at an early age result in immunity in more than 80% of young adults."__ (Mandell 8e)

> - __"In an era in which polio has declined to the point of eradication, JE is now preeminent among causes of pediatric CNS infections in the region."__ (Mandell's 8e)


---
## Diagnosis, treatment and prevention of JEV

> - Diagnosis is best with a PCR panel on blood (true for most flaviviruses)
  - Isolation from CSF is often unsuccessful but is useful during fulminant disease
  - There is a lot of overlap in arbo-flavivirus serologies
  
> - No specific treatment
  - Supportive care should focus on the electrolyte abnormalities that lead to seizures

> - Vaccine is available in the US by brand name __Ixiaro__
  - Approved in those 2 months and up (doses change with age)
  - Primary series is 2 IM injections 28 days apart (plan ahead)
  - This is an inactivated vaccine
  - No clinical efficacy data is available
  - However, other vaccines licensed in the endemic have shown dramatic reductions in infection rates

## Case #2

--- 
## Initial presentation

> - A 47 y/o American woman presents to the ED two days after returning from a trip to Sao Paulo, Brazil with her 13 y/o son. Three days ago she began feeling acutely ill with high fever, chill, frontal headache, back pain, and muscle pain. The next day she boarded a direct flight to Chicago. During the flight, she felt weak and developed a sore throat. Yesterday, she developed non-bloody diarrhea with nausea.

> - Since symptom onset she has been receiving amoxicillin and acetaminophen.

> - On physical exam, she is in acute distress. No signs of bleeding and a normal neuro exam.

> - Vitals are temperature of 35.6C, HR 60, BP 120/80

> - What do we think she has?

---
## More information

> - CBC and CMP
  - Platelets = 98K, WBC = 4K
  - Cr = 6.9, BUN = 151, Alk Phos = 228

> - Liver Function
  - ALT/AST = 23K/49K
  - Tbili = 3.5
  - Dbili = 2.6

> - Coagulation studies
  - PT = 26% normal
  - INR = 3.3
  - CRP = 13.8

> - __What do we think she has?__

## YF is found largely in S. America and Africa

![](assets/img/YF_geogrpahy.png)

---
## Epidemiology and diagnosis of YF

> - Has been around a long time; at least until 1600s
  - Relatively easy to spot... hence the yellow
  
> - Can occur many times annually as discrete sporadic outbreaks
  - Currently there is an outbreak in Brazil
  - An outbreak in Angola and Uganda just stopped last semester

> - Approximately 200,000 cases annually
  - Survives the dry season in mosquito eggs

---
## Clinical disease from YF

> - Initial infection
  - 5% to 50% of infections are asymptomatic
  - Incubation time of 3-6 days
  - Begins with fever, headache, and myalgias
  - Relatively mild initial disease with some conjunctival injections, facial flushing and bradycardia
  
> - Some patients progress to florid hemorrhagic fever

> - It may be easiest to distinguish this as hepatitis + hemorrhagic fever, but that occurs in a minority of patients

> - Albuminuria can usually distinguish YF from other types of hepatitis

---
## Diagnosis, treatment and prevention of YF

> - Can diagnosis serologically but it is rife with issues
  - Lots of cross-reactivity
  - Vaccination status can make IgM positive
  - In first several days, PCR can be successful, but by the time the fulminant symptoms appear the virus is typically undetectable
  
> - No specific treatment
  - Avoid aspirin and NSAIDS
  - Protect patient from mosquito exposure for 5 days after onset
  
> - Vaccine is available
  - Approved for 9 months and older
  - Live-attenuated vaccine (Check contraindications)

## Case #3

---
## HPI
> - A 27-year-old woman was seen in the emergency department of this hospital during the summer because of arthralgias and a rash. She had just returned from a trip to Turks and Caicos.

> - The patient had been well until 5 days before this evaluation, when myalgias in her hands and shoulders developed, along with back pain, neck pain, and a retro-orbital headache.

> - Later that day, fever occurred (temperature, 39.0°C) and was accompanied by chills, nausea, decreased appetite, and sore throat. She also noted a vaginal ulcer, ulcers on the side of her tongue, decreased taste sensation, and enlarged, tender lymph nodes in her neck and groin. 

> - The next morning, the patient awoke with a rash on her right forearm. The lesions were pink, pruritic, and nonpainful. Within 1 hour, the rash spread to her torso and both arms and legs.

> - Her gums bled easily when she brushed her teeth, but the rash remitted.

> - On the fifth day of illness, a new pruritic, erythematous rash developed, beginning on her palms and spreading to her arms, chest, abdomen, back, and legs, sparing the soles of her feet.

---
## Objective information
> - The patient appeared well. The temperature was 36.4°C, the pulse 69 beats per minute, the blood pressure 135/87 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. 

> - There was subtle swelling of soft tissue in the hands but no joint effusions.

> - Tourniquet test was positive

> - __What do we have in the differential?__

## Dengue is found everywhere JEV or YF is found

![](assets/img/dengue_geography.png)

--- &vcenter
## Epidemiology and diagnosis of Dengue

> - Four different types

> - In susceptible populations, attack rate can approach 50-70%

> - Interesting decline of DHF in infants as they age out of passive immunity from mother

> - Prior infections potentiate DHF by a complicated mechanism

> - Again most infections are subclinic

> - Clinical diagnosis is unlikely
  - Best chance is to find Leukopenia, Thrombocytopenia, Neutropenia, and Mild AST/ALT elevation
  
> - PCR is prefered in first 5 days of symptoms
  - IgM/IgG/NS1 are all used but have significant drawbacks
  - As before IgM has substantial overlap with JEV

---
## Treatment and prevention of Dengue

> - In general, even a patient with DHF should not die
  - Appropriate supportive care reduces mortality 50 to 100 fold

> - If they die one of two things likely happened
  - They presented way too late
  - Healthcare providers fluid overloaded them
  
> - IVIg has not been shown to provide benefit
  - Corticosteroids provide no benefit

> - Vaccines
  - One licensed in Mexico; Dengvaxia
  - Many others in development
  - Connection between cross-reactivity and DHF not well established

## Case #4

--- 
## Presentation and workup

> - A 45-year-old woman was seen in an outpatient clinic in Heidelberg, Germany for fever of up to 39°C and rash covering her trunk, arms, and legs.

> - Fever had started on 2 days previously, which was 6 days after she had returned from a 3-week vacation to peninsular Malaysia and Sabah, Malaysian Borneo.

> - Laboratory analyses showed a slightly elevated C-reactive protein level of 5.2 mg/L (reference range <5.0), but liver function test and complete blood count results were within reference range. 

> - During the next 3 days, the fever subsided, but the patient experienced a sore throat, bilateral conjunctivitis, and a burning sensation of the palms and soles. These symptoms were accompanied by swelling of the hands and increasing arthralgia of the wrists, palms, and fingers. There was no lymphadenopathy. 

> - Two days later, the patient experienced sudden bilateral dull and metallic hearing; in her left ear, she experienced a very short delay between a sound and her perception of the sound. 

> - __What do we have in the differential?__
